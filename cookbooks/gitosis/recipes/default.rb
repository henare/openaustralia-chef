#Â git clone git@test.org:gitosis-admin.git
# Add something like the following to gitosis.conf:
#   [group openaustralia]
#   writable = openaustralia openaustralia-parser perllib phplib rblib shlib twfy 
#   members = matthewl
# Which will allow writing to the repositories in 'writable' by the people mentioned in 'members'
# Then commit the changes and push them out
