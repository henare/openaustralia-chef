A rough guide to setting up and configuring the openaustralia server:

* Install FreeBSD (I'm using 7.0 currently) (Install ports collection and don't add another user other than root)
* Allow root login over ssh (vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config)
* Restart sshd: /etc/rc.d/sshd restart
* Install Rubygems: pkg_add -r ruby18-gems
* Upgrade Rubygems:
# gem update
# gem update --system
# mv /usr/local/bin/gem18 /usr/local/bin/gem
* Install Chef:
# gem sources -a http://gems.opscode.com
* gem install chef
* Synchronise the clock a little better than before: ntpdate tick.ucla.edu
* Ensure that in Capfile, port for ssh is at the default and the user is set to root
* cap chef
* cap deploy
